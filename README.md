# song-extract

Shiny app using seewave to select and extract temporal and frequency measures from bird song

Brief and extremely basic usage:

- Save R scripts to a Project folder (e.g., "song-extract")
- In RStudio, open ui.R and click on "Run App" (upper right corner of script pane)
- Otherwise shiny::runApp("song-extract") (Assuming your working director is the same as the song-extract folder)
